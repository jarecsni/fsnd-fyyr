1) Add the data using dbsandbox (all venues, shows, etc.) - these will be reused in a migration script to load the initial data
=> DB is fully functional, it has the right schema and the right data

2) Replace canned data with real data (selects, inserts)
3) Build out the migration script:
   1) Add basic schema
   2) Add missing attributes
   3) Add data

4) Test: check out the project, run the migration and see if the app is fully functional
